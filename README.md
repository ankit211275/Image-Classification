# **Sad or Happy Image Classifier**

This project is a deep learning model developed to classify images into two categories: Happy or Sad. The model is built from scratch using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and predict the sentiment from images.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can accurately distinguish between images depicting happy or sad emotions. The classifier uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract features from the images, followed by fully connected layers to classify the image into one of the two categories.
Requirements

To run this project, the following Python packages are required:

tensorflow (for deep learning model creation and training)
numpy (for numerical operations),
opencv-python (for image processing),
matplotlib (for visualizing results),
pandas (for data manipulation)

### Dataset

The dataset consists of images labeled as either Happy or Sad. Each image is pre-processed by resizing to 256x256 pixels, and the labels are encoded as either 0 (Sad) or 1 (Happy). The data is split into training, validation, and test sets.

Training Data: Used to train the model.

Validation Data: Used to validate the model's performance during training.

Test Data: Used to evaluate the model's final performance after training.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of the following layers:


#### Conv2D Layer: Convolutional layer with 16 filters, filter size of 3x3, and ReLU activation.

#### MaxPooling2D Layer: Pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2.

#### Conv2D Layer: Convolutional layer with 32 filters.

#### MaxPooling2D Layer: Pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2.

#### Conv2D Layer: Convolutional layer with 64 filters.

#### MaxPooling2D Layer: Pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2.

#### Flatten Layer: Flattening the 3D output to 1D.

#### Dense Layer: Fully connected layer with 256 neurons.

#### Output Layer: Dense layer with 1 neuron for binary classification (Happy/Sad).

The model uses the **binary cross-entropy loss** function and **Adam** optimizer for training.

## Future Improvements

**Augmenting the dataset** with more images and diverse facial expressions to improve the model's robustness.

**Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimizing the model's hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of filters, etc.) to enhance performance.

**Transfer learning:** Using pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, etc., to improve accuracy.
